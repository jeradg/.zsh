# .zsh

(Based on [my previous attempt at customizing oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/jeradg/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/.zshrc).)

My zsh config (for use with oh-my-zsh).

## Usage

First, [install Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh#basic-installation).

Then install this config with

```sh
zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeradg/.zsh/main/install.sh)"
```
